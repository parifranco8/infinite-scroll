# infinite-scroll
This project shows the infinite scroll functionality while displaying images. The images are fetched by the unsplash API. 
All the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide the loading animation. It is one long column of images with a margin on the left
and right. As you scroll near the bottom you can see the scroll bar load while the network is fetching for more images. This depicts a seamless experience.

See it for yourself!
